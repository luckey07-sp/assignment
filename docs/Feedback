Feedback
This assignment was a great opportunity to work with both frontend and backend integration,
 API consumption, and data visualization. It aligns well with my experience in full‑stack 
 development, especially in building backend services and creating clean, user‑friendly UIs. 
 The setup and environment configuration took a fair amount of time since I started from 
 scratch, but overall it was an engaging and valuable exercise.
